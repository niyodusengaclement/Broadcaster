            <h1>Corruption is a huge bane to Africa’s development.</h1>
            <p>
                “When, in a society, the shameless triumph, when the abuser is admired, if the people tolerate it, if everything becomes corrupt but the majority is quiet because their own is benefiting. When so many ‘ifs’ unite, perhaps it is time to appraisal our activities, re-examine those around us, and return to ourselves,” he reckoned.

For example, citizenry must be engaged and encouraged by civil society organizations to participate in public debates and the media against corrupt practices, while more anti-corruption clubs should be established and reinforced in schools and communities at village levels.

For sustainability, religious leaders, who wield huge influence on the people, must also be brought on board, observed one Josephine Amanda, an entrepreneur.

“By effecting adequate social sanctions against deeds of malfeasance, the anti-corruption crusade would win new committed converts among citizens,” says Amanda.

To Karemangingo, any strategy being deployed in the fight against all sorts of corruption must necessarily have incorporated in it aggressive education of the citizens on the direct evil-effects of corruption on their lives.

If, for example, Rwf20 billion have been embezzled, a citizen down in Cyato (Nyamasheke District) should be made to understand how many health centres, schools or even decent shelter for community members this money would have built. 

Business ethics and staff morality

The Rwanda Bribery Index 2018 by Transparency International Rwanda (TI-RW) indicates that cases of corruption in the private sector “remain rampant”.  This shows that corruption can be as ingrained into a company’s culture as to be considered ‘the way business is done around here’. 

This can be the case especially for companies who use agents, ‘facilitation payments’ are seen as the norm for business acquisition where bribes are commonly used to win contracts.

Real or perceived pressure to meet business targets can render individuals incapable of putting ethical decision-making into effect. When management declares a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption (as an ethical issues), then they must demonstrate that they will support staff if they lose contracts or business in the short-term as a result.

Though, ethics is often confused with legality; unethical behavior with illegal behavior. In broad overview, morality (generally within the realm of personal conscience, and is typically private), ethics, and the law are all part of a continuum of sometimes overlapping considerations.        

Creating a culture of integrity and openness - where ethical dilemmas arising from doing business in corruption ‘hotspots’ are discussed can be one way of to mitigate against the risk of an ethical lapse.
