            <h1>Taxi-moto accidents take their toll</h1>
            <p>
                    At the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali’s causality ward, Raymond Karamage, 26, is lying on a bed; his heavily bandaged left leg in a suspended position supported by cords.

                    Karamage, a taxi-moto operator, was on his way from Shyorongi to Kigali when he sustained an ankle and thigh bone fracture following a head-on collision with a car early last month.
                    
                    This resident of Nyabugogo suburb, a City of Kigali suburb, went into coma for a week. He has since undergone ankle repair surgery and is now waiting for a similar procedure for his broken thigh bone.
                    
                    Karamage is just one of the growing numbers of victims of motorbike accident which Dan Munyuza, deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations), attributes to over speeding, recklessness and ridding under the influence drugs.
                    
                    Statistics released by the Rwanda National Police (RNP) last month, show that 204 road accidents were caused by motorcyclists in August across the country, and that 176 of them were within Kigali.
                    
                    Indeed, a visit to hospitals in the city suburbs reveals a worrisome situation.<br><br>

                    
                    At Kibagabaga Hospital in Gasabo District, Ferdinand Ngabonziza, 24, a security guard working with Intersec, lies in the emergency and accidents ward, with a broken left leg, bruised right hand and face.
                    
                    “I had stopped at the roadside in Ndera sector to speak to a friend when a rider lost control crashing my bicycle and causing these injuries to me,” he said.
                    
                    Ngabonziza who had under gone a leg scan was referred to Rwanda Military Hospital for orthopedic surgery.<br><br>

                    A few meters away from  him is Viateur Musoni, 40, a broadcast technician, seated on a plastic chair with his right leg being plastered by a nurse after undergoing some kind of therapy.

A day before, Musoni, while riding  a personnel motorcycle on some murram road in Kinyinya, Gasabo District, was  hit by a speeding taxi-moto from the opposite direction. He suffered a dislocation of the ankle.

Even when armed with health insurance, he still has to part with Rwf80,000 in medical bills for the service.
